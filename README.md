# python-v4l2

Provides Python bindings for Video4Linux2.

Based on the work of [Jinlei Zheng](https://github.com/AlexJinlei/python-v4l2),
which was based in turn on [python-v4l2](https://pypi.org/project/v4l2/).

Additions have been made for the H264 format and for Python3.

## Installation

Can be installed via:

```
pip3 install v4l2-python3
```

Or alternatively on Raspberry Pi OS (bullseye):

```
sudo apt install python3-v4l2
```

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/RaspberryPiFoundation/python-v4l2/wiki) for PyPI publishing instructions.
